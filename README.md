## üí† Pipelines

Glitter offers a way to encapsulate the chain of responsibility pattern in a way that is easy to understand and maintain through what we call a pipeline. A pipeline is a collection of processors that are executed in order, and each processor can choose to handle the request or pass it on to the next processor in the chain. This allows for a clean separation of concerns, and the ability to easily add or remove processors from the pipeline.

```csharp
IPipeline<int> fizzBuzzPipeline = Pipeline.CreateFor<int>(optimize: true)
    .Using<FizzBuzzProcessor>()
    .Using<FizzProcessor>()
    .Using<BuzzProcessor>()
    .Using<DefaultProcessor>();

foreach (int number in Enumerable.Range(1, 100))
    await fizzBuzzPipeline.Process(number);
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Guard Clauses

Guard clauses are a way to encapsulate the logic for validating input parameters to a method. This allows for a clean separation of concerns, and the ability to easily add or remove guard clauses from a method.

```csharp
public void DoSomething(int? number)
{
    CreateGuard.For(number, nameof(number))
        .AgainstNull()
        .AgainstLessThan(0)
        .AgainstGreaterThan(100)
        .Against(x => x % 2 == 0, "Number must be odd");
}
```
